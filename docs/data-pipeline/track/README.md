# Apache HTrace

http://htrace.incubator.apache.org/developer_guide.html

Apache HTrace is an open source framework for distributed tracing. It can be used with both standalone applications and libraries.

By adding HTrace support to your project, you will allow end-users to trace their requests. In addition, any other project that uses HTrace can follow the requests it makes to your project. That's why we say HTrace is “end-to-end.”

HTrace was designed for use in big distributed systems such as the Apache Hadoop Distributed Filesystem and the Apache HBase storage engine. However, there is nothing Hadoop-specific about HTrace. It has no dependencies on Hadoop, and is a useful building block for many distributed systems.
