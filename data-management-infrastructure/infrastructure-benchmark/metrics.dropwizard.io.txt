=== 1 Meter
A meter measures the rate of events over time (e.g., “requests per second”). 
In addition to the mean rate, meters also track 1-, 5-, and 15-minute moving averages.

=== 2 Reporter
A Console Reporter is exactly what it sounds like - report to the console.
Supported Reporters:
STDOUT, using ConsoleReporter from metrics-core
CSV files, using CsvReporter from metrics-core
SLF4J loggers, using Slf4jReporter from metrics-core
Ganglia, using GangliaReporter from metrics-ganglia
Graphite, using GraphiteReporter from metrics-graphite

report metrics via JMX: JmxReporter.

Metrics also ships with a servlet (AdminServlet) which will serve a JSON representation of 
all registered metrics. It will also run health checks, print out a thread dump, and 
provide a simple “ping” response for load-balancers. 
(It also has single servlets–MetricsServlet, HealthCheckServlet, ThreadDumpServlet, and 
PingServlet–which do these individual tasks.)

=== 3 Registry
The centerpiece of Metrics is the MetricRegistry class, 
which is the container for all your application’s metrics.

=== 4 Gauges
A gauge is an instantaneous measurement of a value. 
For example, we may want to measure the number of pending jobs in a queue.

=== 5 Counters
A counter is just a gauge for an AtomicLong instance. You can increment or decrement its value. 
For example, we may want a more efficient way of measuring the pending job in a queue.

=== 6 Histograms
A histogram measures the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data. 
In addition to minimum, maximum, mean, etc., it also measures median, 
75th, 90th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles.

=== 7 Timers
A timer measures both the rate that a particular piece of code is called and 
the distribution of its duration.

=== 8 Health Checks
Metrics also has the ability to centralize your service’s health checks with 
the metrics-healthchecks module.
